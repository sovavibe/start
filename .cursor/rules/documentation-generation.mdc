# DOCUMENTATION GENERATION

See ai-rules.mdc for main rules. This file: specific guidance only.

## WHEN TO CREATE
✅ ONLY when user EXPLICITLY asks: "create docs", "document this", "write README" | ✅ Place in `docs/` (not `.archive/`) | ✅ ONE concise file (< 200 lines) | ❌ NO automatic generation, summaries, plans, duplicates

## PROHIBITIONS
❌ Automatic README/API/architecture docs | ❌ "Completion reports" | ❌ Multiple files for same topic | ❌ Long files (> 200 lines) | ❌ "For future reference" | Focus on code, not docs
