# DOCUMENTATION GENERATION - STRICT RULES

## ❌ CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS
- ❌ NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md, README, etc.)
- ❌ NEVER generate documentation unless EXPLICITLY requested in user query
- ❌ NEVER create "completion summaries" as documentation
- ❌ NEVER create multiple documentation files for same topic
- ❌ NEVER create documentation "for future reference"
- ❌ NEVER create documentation as "best practices guide" without request
- ❌ NEVER generate documentation to "explain what was done"
- ❌ NEVER create documentation to "help with future work"

## ✅ STRICT RULES
- ✅ ONLY create documentation when user EXPLICITLY asks: "create docs", "document this", "write README"
- ✅ Focus on code implementation, NOT documentation
- ✅ Place instructions, guides, setup docs in `docs/` directory (NOT in `.archive/`)
- ❌ NEVER place useful documentation in `.archive/` (only temporary/research materials go there)

## PROHIBITIONS - TOKEN CONSERVATION
- ❌ NO automatic README generation
- ❌ NO automatic API documentation
- ❌ NO automatic architecture diagrams
- ❌ NO automatic code comments documentation
- ❌ NO "helpful" documentation suggestions
- ❌ NO "completion reports" as documentation
- ❌ NO multiple files for same feature
- ❌ NO long documentation files (> 200 lines)

## EXCEPTIONS - ONLY THESE
- User EXPLICITLY requests: "create documentation"
- User EXPLICITLY asks: "document this feature"
- User EXPLICITLY requests: "write README"
- User EXPLICITLY asks: "create guide for X"

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION
- ✅ If documentation needed, create ONE concise file (< 200 lines)
- ✅ Focus on essential information only
- ✅ No redundant information
- ✅ No "summary of what was done" sections
