# ARCHIVE DIRECTORY

## PURPOSE
`.archive/` directory is for:
- Temporary documentation for prompts/research
- AI-generated responses and notes
- Internal project notes not needed for opensource
- Historical documentation that's not actively maintained
- Draft documentation that's not ready for contributors

## BEST PRACTICES (Industry Standard)
Based on GitHub, open source projects, and SDLC best practices:
- **`docs/`** = Public, useful documentation for contributors and users (setup guides, API docs, architecture, best practices)
- **`.archive/`** = Private, temporary materials (research, AI notes, internal drafts, deprecated docs)

## RULES
- ✅ Place prompt-specific docs, research notes, AI responses in `.archive/`
- ✅ Archive outdated documentation that's not needed for contributors
- ❌ NEVER commit `.archive/` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ❌ NEVER reference `.archive/` in production code or main docs
- ❌ NEVER place instructions, guides, setup docs, or useful documentation in `.archive/`
- ✅ Place instructions, guides, setup docs, and useful documentation in `docs/`
- ✅ Keep essential opensource docs in root/docs: README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, setup guides, instructions
- ✅ Place quality/process documentation (code metrics, best practices, SDLC guides) in `docs/quality/` or `docs/`

## IGNORED BY
- Git (`.gitignore`)
- Linters (checkstyle, PMD, spotbugs)
- SonarQube
- Build tools
